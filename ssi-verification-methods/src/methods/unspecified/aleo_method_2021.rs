/// identifies an Aleo network as specified in the proposed [CAIP for Aleo Blockchain
/// Reference][caip-aleo-chain-ref]. Signatures use parameters defined per network. Currently only
/// network id "1" (CAIP-2 "aleo:1" / [Aleo Testnet I][testnet1]) is supported. The account
/// address format is documented in [Aleo
